	"pl_output": "{\"ok\":false,\"msg\":\"abandoned_xb895b.mitta is a safety wrapper with a difference - it protects both script owners and script runners alike. When run from the CLI, it checks that all of its scriptor arguments are above the `Nsafe` level, then executes its `Nrun` argument, passing in all of its remaining arguments.\\n\\nScript owners can take advantage of abandoned_xb895b.mitta by adding the following lines to the top of their script, immediately after a call to kanavoy.karan, if that script is also being used. The template used here is only an example, and templates are optional.\\n\\nlet template = {amount:{type:\\\"gc_num\\\", min:0}, xfer:{type:\\\"scriptor\\\", values:[\\\"accts.xfer_gc_to\\\"]}}\\nargs = #fs.abandoned_xb895b.mitta(args,template)\\n\\nThis guarantees that any scriptor arguments can be used safely, as if your script was the top-level script call.\\n\\nTemplates consist of an object with keys of the arguments you expect, and values for those keys comprised of a `Ntype` (any JavaScript type, plus `Vany`, `Vgc_str`, `Vgc_num`, `Vinteger`, and `Vscriptor`), and optionally any `Ntop`, `Nmax`, `Nmin`, `Nint` (integer), `Ndefault`, and arrays of `Nvalues` and `Nusers`. If the `Ntype` is `Vscriptor`, the `Vvalues` consist of scriptor names you are prepared to accept.\\n\\nIf `Ntop` is true, then the argument will be deleted if the top level script is not the caller or abandoned_xb895b.mitta. This is useful for, for instance, making sure only the user can enter confirm:true and not a malicious wrapper.\\n\\nThe `Nusers` array is a list of users who are permitted to pass that argument. Useful for locking commands down to only a certain whitelist of users.\\n\\nThe `Ndefault` value replaces both unspecified and illegal arguments.\\n\\nFor instance, in the example above, I expect two arguments. `Namount`, which is a positive number or GC string, and `Nxfer`, which is a scriptor to accts.xfer_gc_to. Excess arguments not in the template are passed through unmodified.\"}",
