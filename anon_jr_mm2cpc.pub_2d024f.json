Always remember to scripts.get_level what you're running: \\n\\n * If its MIDSEC, it can take your GC! \\n * If its LOWSEC, it can take GC, take/delete upgrades and record your own loc!! \\n * If its NULLSEC, it can do whatever a script can do!!! \\n\\nAdditionally, scripts.get_access_level can tell you if the script is hidden or not. A loc is ALWAYS hidden, and will record your loc on the user's system. For most npcs this is fine as they self-destruct, but players don't!\"}",
